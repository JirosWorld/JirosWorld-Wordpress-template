JirosWorld Wordpress Template

JirosWorld Wordpress theme with a slimmed down Bootstrap CSS file and slimmed down jQuery, by Jiro Ghianni

This repository is a GitHub practice repo, in order to present my fully functional Wordpress theme for all to see. JirosWorld Wordpress Template's main goal is to function as a simple starter theme, with not just a minified Bootstrap CSS file, but actually cutting out the parts we don't need for this template. This allows me to practice `git` commands. 

See README.md for more info.
