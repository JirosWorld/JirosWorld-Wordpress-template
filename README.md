# JirosWorld Wordpress Template

**JirosWorld Wordpress theme with a slimmed down Bootstrap CSS file and slimmed down jQuery, by Jiro Ghianni**

This repository is a GitHub practice repo, in order to present my fully functional Wordpress theme for all to see. 

#### Goals

JirosWorld Wordpress Template's main goal is to function as a simple starter theme, with not just a minified Bootstrap CSS file, but actually cutting out the parts we don't need for this template. This allows me to practice `git` commands. But also:

* Bootstrap
* HTML5 & CSS3
* PHP loops
* jQuery
* javascript
* OTAP/DTAP
* Deployment
* and the lovely oldschool Markdown language.

#### And more?
